This is a mini project done when i am pursuing my engineerinf first year this porject is a java based built which works in the scripting file only gives a suduko unsolved map which has to be solved by us in the console by giving inputs if the specific position nd value for that place is right then the map is updated with this value in it otherwise you are gonna have to try it again. 
Try my mini suduko map .
And the other one is a basic display project which can manage a student database called schoolmanagementsystem.
